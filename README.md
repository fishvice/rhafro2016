# Hafro goes R



### Preamble
___

The lecture series will tackle some recent development in R. The intended structure of the course is to have a weekly seminar/practical lab which introduces a particular topic followed by a small assignment as well as suggested further readings.

The series is intended for those that have not very much experience in using R as their daily working environment. The instructors will be Bjarki Þór Elvarsson and Einar Hjörleifsson.

The seminars will be in English, this being because the R environment is in that language as well as to accommodate potential participants whose native language may be other then Icelandic.
